 ## Overview
 This started as a small simple website I made using HTML and CSS in my free time. During fall of 2023 between my classes and on my free time I would design and work on this website. I knew I wanted it to become something more serious and be used as a real store, so I got to studying on the little free time I had.

 A simple store, where one can purchase coffee, the user provides info and their credit information. DO NOT PROVIDE REAL INFO. It used JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and HTML

 ## Known_Issues
 Depending on where the program is stored, it might fail to create and edit the txt file. It works on some but fails for others. SQL or another information gathering program would fix it.

 ## Works_Cited
 This was a hard website to make. I was busy all year and I had to make it while working full time. Regardless it got done and the following resourses were used
 Learning Web Design by Jennifer Niederst: No further notes.
 Javascript and JQuerry by Jon Ducket: The book touches on JSON, and AJAX which was very helpful here and will be in future projects
